To make sure my software works the way it should, I test it often during development. I check each part of the code as I go, and I also use automated tests to catch issues quickly. For security, I make sure to handle user input carefully to avoid things like hackers breaking in or causing errors. I follow secure coding practices, keep my software updated, and use tools that help find weaknesses before they become problems.
I try to learn what users need by asking questions, reviewing feedback, or studying the project requirements. Once I know what they're looking for, I turn those ideas into specific features. I design the program to be simple and easy for them to use. I also check in with users during development to make sure I’m on the right track and making something useful for them.
When starting a new project, I first figure out what the software is supposed to do. Then, I plan how the different parts will work together and what tools I’ll need. I like to build the program in smaller steps so I can test along the way and make changes if needed. I also focus on writing clear, organized code that will be easy to update or expand later.
